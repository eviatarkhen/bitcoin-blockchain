# Bitcoin Blockchain Implementation

Learning blockchain technology from first principles by implementing core concepts from the Bitcoin whitepaper.

## Learning Goals

- Understand proof-of-work consensus
- Implement blockchain data structures
- Build transaction validation system
- Explore cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- Study Merkle trees for efficient verification
- Understand UTXO model
- Implement difficulty adjustment

## Implementation Plan

1. **Basic Blockchain** - Blocks, hashing, chain validation
2. **Proof-of-Work** - Mining, difficulty targets, nonce finding
3. **Transactions** - Digital signatures, UTXO model
4. **Network** - P2P concepts, consensus rules
5. **Merkle Trees** - Space-efficient verification
6. **Advanced** - SPV, pruning, fee markets

## Resources

- [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
- Implementation language: Python (for clarity)

## Progress

- [ ] Phase 1: Simple blockchain with PoW
- [ ] Phase 2: Transaction system
- [ ] Phase 3: Network consensus
- [ ] Phase 4: Optimizations (Merkle trees, pruning)
